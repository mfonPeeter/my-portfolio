# My Portfolio

I made use of React and Tailwind CSS to create my portfolio site.

Below is an image from the portfolio site:

To get started with the project, simply clone the repo and then open your code editor and run the command `npm install` to install the packages. Then, run the command `npm start`
to run the app in development mode. It will open http://localhost:3000 to view the website in your browser. The page will reload when you make changes.

You can view the site on http://mfonpeter.netlify.app/
